# Plot Prophet
This project aims to analyze Bengaluru house data and build a model to predict house prices. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms to create a regression model. The project utilizes the Bengaluru house data to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling. The dataset contains information about various aspects of houses, such as location, size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and price. The goal is to develop a model that can predict house prices based on these features.

# Languages and Frameworks/Libraries
The project is implemented using Python with the following frameworks and libraries:

* **pandas:** used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **numpy:** used for mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
* **matplotlib:** used for data visualization, particularly for creating plots and charts.
* **scikit-learn:** a machine learning library that provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
* **pickle:** used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
* **json:** used for working with JSON data.

# Installation and Execution
To install and execute the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure that Python (version 3.0 and above) is installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
4. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or editor.
5. Run the source code file to execute the project.

# Configuration
1. Ensure that the necessary dataset file (Bengaluru_House_Data.csv) is present in the project directory.
2. Open the source code file in your Python IDE or editor.
3. Run the code to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new house data by calling the appropriate functions or methods.

# Conclusion
The project successfully analyzes the Bengaluru house data and builds a regression model to predict house prices. By utilizing data cleaning techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, the model can provide insights into the factors influencing house prices in Bengaluru. The project can be further extended by incorporating additional features or exploring different algorithms to enhance the prediction accuracy.
